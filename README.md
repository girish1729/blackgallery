# Simple image gallery for Angular, Svelte, React and Vue

## Source for porting

Make sure you have typescript installed globally.

```shell
# npm install -g typescript
```

```shell

cd source
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

The build takes care of converting typescript to JavaScript.

The project is split into packages and demo directories.

The package builds a module that can be uploaded to npm registry.

The demo simply installs the module and acts as an example for
integration into third party projects.
